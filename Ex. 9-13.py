#Processing with OrderedDict Rewrite: Start with Exercise 6-4 (p. 113), in which the standard dictionary 
# is used to represent the glossary. Rewrite the program using the OrderedDict class and 
# make sure that the order of output matches the order in which keyâ€”value pairs are added to the dictionary.
