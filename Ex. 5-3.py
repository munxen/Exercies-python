#Colors 1: Imagine that an alien ship has just been hit in your computer game. 
# Create a variable named alien_color and assign it the value ‘green’, ‘yellow’ or ‘red'.
# Write the if command to verify that the variable contains the value ‘green'.If the condition is true, 
# display a message that the player has just earned 5 points.
#Write one version of the program in which the if condition is met, and another version in which it is 
# not being executed. (In the second version, no message should be displayed.)
