#Animals: Create a list of three (or more) animals that share a common characteristic. 
#Use the for loop to output the names of all animals.
#Change the program so that instead of a simple name, a message is displayed, 
#including this name, for example "A dog would make a great pet".
#add a line at the end of the program with a description of the general property. For example, you can 
#display the message "Any of these animals would make a great pet!".

for pet in pets:
    print("A",pet,"would make a great pet")
