#9-4. Visitors: Start with the program from exercise 9-1 (p. 165). Add the number_served attribute with the value 
# default is 0; it represents the number of visitors served. Create an instance named restaurant.
# Output the number_served value, then change it and output it again. Add a method named set_number_served(),
# which allows you to set the number of visitors served. Call the method with a new number, output again
# value 170. Add a method named increment_number_served(), which increases the number of serviced
# visitors by a given amount. Call this method with any number that could represent
# the number of clients served â€” say, in one day.
